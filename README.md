# Pathfinding-Algorithms-Project
This project contains Python implementations of various pathfinding algorithms designed to navigate through grids or graphs, finding the shortest or most efficient path from a start point to a target. The implemented algorithms include:

*A (A-Star)**: An informed search algorithm that uses both the cost to reach a node and a heuristic to estimate the cost to reach the target, making it highly efficient in finding optimal paths.
Breadth-First Search (BFS): An uninformed search algorithm that explores nodes layer by layer, ensuring the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
Depth-First Search (DFS): A search algorithm that explores nodes along each branch to its depth before backtracking, useful for applications requiring exhaustive exploration.


Technologies Used:

Python: Core language for implementing algorithms
Data structures: Utilized queues, stacks, and priority queues for efficient algorithm operations
This repository is ideal for those interested in learning or demonstrating knowledge of pathfinding techniques, algorithm optimization, and graph traversal methods.
